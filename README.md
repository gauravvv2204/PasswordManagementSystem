# Password Management System
This is a Database Mangement System project for your Password Management in daily life.
We have implimented this using Java and PL/SQL.
We have used RSA and SHA256 encryptions for the protection of all the passwords stored in our Database.
There are diffrent classes implimented for RSA and Table printings.

## Usage
Execute all files in `SQL` folder on the SQL Developer Server.
Once done, fill in the `user` , `password` and `url` in the `main` file to connect to your server.
Now Run and Enjoy!

We have used a package for SHA256 which can be found [here](https://github.com/CruiserX/sha256_plsql).
